## Results Interpretation
- r (Pearson correlation) measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between temperature and crime
  - r > 0 → as temperature increases, crime tends to increase
  - r < 0 → as temperature increases, crime tends to decrease
  - |r| close to 1 → strong relationship; |r| close to 0 → weak relationship
- p-value shows whether that relationship is statistically significant
  - p < 0.05 → statistically significant relationship (unlikely due to chance)
 
## Summary of Findings:
- Total daily crime vs. temperature: r = 0.182, p < 0.001 → weak but statistically significant positive relationship
- Top correlation offenses:
  - Motor Vehicle Theft (r = 0.112)
  - Vandalism (r = 0.098)
  - Simple Assault (r = 0.079)
- Other offenses such as Burglary and Suspicious Activity showed little to no correlation
Overall, warmer days correspond to slightly higher crime counts, but the effect is modest and below our hypothesized threshold (r ≥ 0.5). Temperature alone is therefore not a strong predictor of daily crime in Charlottesville.
